# opencrabs-dev — OpenCrabs source procedure

**Owns:** everything touching `~/opencrabs` source, its GitHub Actions runs, or the
installed `opencrabs` binary. This file = shared facts + role router only. Actual
procedures live in FIVE role files (`editor.md` / `hq.md` / `triage.md` / `toolsmith.md` / `harvest.md`);
load ONLY the one matching the session's role.

**Binding owner directives** (sync policy, upstream PR law, carriers/builds, cargo
prohibition, telegram surface law, gates, editor creation, tool-problem triage (Triage lane),
cadence) live in `fleet-directives.md` — re-homed from ops AGENTS.md/MEMORY.md per
owner order 2026-09-02. Load it before ANY opencrabs-dev work. Executing procedure for the sync
policy's rebase procedure: `upstream-merge-runbook.md` (freeze gate, roles, conflict
classes, migration-union rule, semantic-triage defaults).

## STEP ZERO — establish the role (mandatory on every load)

Ask the operator which role this session employs before doing anything:

> **Editor / HQ / Triage / Toolsmith / Harvest?**

| Role | Owns | Procedure file |
|------|------|----------------|
| **EDITOR** | Commits + error fixes: claim issue → worktree → code → CI gate → sign → push → ff-merge into fork `main` → `oc-deploy ship` → smoke on notify. **The editor's obligation ENDS at smoke evidence** — feature COMPLETE means the evidence is posted and the feature is handed to the HARVEST lane | `editor.md` |
| **HQ** | Skill set maintenance, worker ledger, Duty 4 worker polls, Duty 6 periodic lens reviews — count derived from the catalog at gate time (details in `hq.md` and `review-lenses.md`) | `hq.md` |
| **TRIAGE** | Intake & hygiene: issue assignment, repo hygiene patrols, rebase/merge execution delegated from HQ, upstream lifecycle tracking (delta watch, PR census, dependency tracking folded from Harvester v0.4.176) | `triage.md` |
| **TOOLSMITH** | CLI tools author & maintainer: owns `tools/` code, test battery stewardship, direct recipient of tool quirks/defects (v0.4.176) | `toolsmith.md` |
| **HARVEST** | Upstream contribution: port → CI gate → file → follow. Consumes a cluster Triage surfaced and marked READY; owns the harvest branch, the gate dispatch, the upstream PR and its lifecycle (v0.4.250, owner order 2026-09-24 centralising harvest) | `harvest.md` |

Roles **DO NOT intersect**:

- The Editor NEVER installs/swaps binaries, NEVER restarts daemons, NEVER dispatches
  BUILD runs — shipping goes through `oc-deploy ship` (S3). BUILD TRIGGERS = exactly
  TWO with NO exceptions (§Hard rules, A3 ruling 2026-08-29); the Phase-7 PR-head
  gate is the step-2c pr-checks dispatch — a lint/test gate, not a build trigger.
- Hand-off point: the Editor produces (branch pushed AND fast-forwarded into fork
  `main` + reported shas); `oc-deploy ship` takes it from there (dispatch → poll
  → swap-execute, consent eliminated 2026-08-28). If the run is RED, `oc-deploy`
  reports evidence and stops — fixing code is always Editor work.
- The TRIAGE lane NEVER edits skill files (single-writer law unchanged — the
  HQ is the sole author), NEVER settles protocol disputes (rulings =
  HQ Duty 5), NEVER executes builds/swaps (strict routing, triage.md).
- The TOOLSMITH lane owns `tools/` CODE only (v0.4.87 carve-out) — skill markdown +
  fleet-directives stay HQ-only, daemon/carrier source stays Editor territory,
  NEVER settles protocol disputes (rulings = HQ Duty 5).
- The HARVEST lane owns the upstream PR lifecycle ONLY — it NEVER edits skill markdown (HQ-only), NEVER installs/swaps binaries, NEVER restarts daemons, NEVER dispatches builds, NEVER settles protocol disputes (rulings = HQ Duty 5).
- **The EDITOR's obligation ends at smoke evidence.** Harvest census, porting, upstream branch creation, PR filing and upstream lifecycle belong to the HARVEST lane — an editor lane that finds itself harvesting has taken work it does not own.
- **PRIORITY AUTHORITY (owner order 2026-09-15):** ALL lanes (Editor, HQ, Triage, Toolsmith, Harvest) have complete, independent authority over priorities, sequencing, and task ordering within their codified scopes — never ask the human operator about priorities.

If the request mixes roles (e.g. "fix X and deploy it"), split into separate
role loads — do not fuse the roles in one pass without Alexey saying so explicitly.

## Canonical tooling (v0.4.12, PROCESS-TOOL ownership)

Mechanical rituals the roles once hand-ran are now single commands in `tools/` (CLI-tool creation/fix is
the TOOLSMITH lane's scope, v0.4.87). This section is the register; archived compiler-step anchors live at
`tools/archive/compiler.md`. Fleet-wide rc conventions + the FULL per-tool rc register (the SOLE register):
`tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md` (lens A H1/B F1, v0.4.79; rows below carry purpose only):

**Directory layout — one level per KIND (v0.4.254):** `tools/` holds the `oc-*` fleet executables (the public interface) grouped ONE LEVEL PER FUNCTION — `audit/` `git/` `harvest/` `issue/` `notify/` `ship/` `smoke/` `state/` — beside `tools/lib/` shared helpers, `tools/tests/` the battery, `tools/archive/` retired tools, `tools/docs/` the law that documents the tools, and **`tools/instruments/` corpus-agnostic analysis tools that are NOT fleet tools** — an instrument that reviews an arbitrary corpus has no place in the `oc-*` namespace, and lands there instead.

| Tool | Slot |
|---|---|
| `./tools/ship/oc-order-validate <sha>` | ORDER gates inside `oc-deploy ship` |
| `./tools/ship/oc-job-verify <run-id> <source-ref> [--features] [--identity-only]` | standalone run-identity gate (provenance of RED runs) |
| `./tools/ship/oc-artifact-verify <artifact-path> [--source <sha>] [--run-id <id>] [--markers m1,m2] [--expect-sha <sha256>] [--expect-version <v>] [--repo R] [--json]` | EXECUTION SANITY SIGNAL + FEATURE-PRESENCE CHECK |
| `./tools/ship/oc-seal-state [--sha S] [...]` | baseline/orders seal (flag-based interface — no positional `<sha>`) |
| `./tools/state/oc-attrib --repo <path> (--range <A..B> or --deployed) [--ledger <f>] [--contributors] [--novel\|--no-novel]` | commit-range → worker-lane attribution; `--contributors` projects the 3-col TSV (SINGLE SHAPE); `--deployed` composes the range from `deployed.sha` + `prev_sha` (fan-out compute backend for [issue #24](https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/24)) and IMPLIES `--novel` (#407: drops re-sha'd + empty commits; `--no-novel` restores the raw range) |
| `./tools/ship/oc-deploy <mode>` | the ship path itself — `ship` / `poll` / `swap-execute` / `status [--json]` / `watch [--with-delta]` / `fanout` / `contributors` RETIRED (use `oc-attrib --contributors`). Editor S3 path: `editor.md` §Ship. Verdict codes + wait semantics: tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md |
| `./tools/ship/oc-deploy fanout --run <id> [--dry-run]` | mechanical notify fan-out for one carrier run ([#24](https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/24)); auto-fired at `swap_execute` tail + on `poll` RED-scan; `OC_DEPLOY_NOFANOUT=1` suppresses — mechanics + journal vocabulary in `s2-swap-journal-spec.md` §Fan-out legs |
| `./tools/ship/oc-carrier-features [--fetch] [--repo <path>] [--ref <branch>]` | reads the carrier-yml `features` default at `origin/<ref>`; `oc-deploy ship/poll` resolves EMPTY `--features` through this — carrier read failure aborts the ship loudly |
| `./tools/issue/oc-issue-sweep '<query>' [--fork R] [--upstream R] [--limit N]` | closed-issue hygiene sweep (HQ duty) |
| `./tools/state/oc-skew-scan [--ledger f] [--current v]` | ledger worker-version skew vs current skill version (HQ roster review) |
| `./tools/notify/oc-ping-proof <uuid> <ping-ts> [--ledger f]` | post-swap notify proof: WOKEN / SILENT / UNREACHABLE verdict |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-pr-atomicity <pr-number>` | atomicity gate (harvest Phase 7 / issue triage) |
| `./tools/state/oc-ledger <verb>` | workers-ledger: stamp/sync/check-version/cadence/ack/enroll/roster/commit-pending/claim-ref/confirm/events — `--verbs` lists registered subcommands; unrecognized verbs emit vocabulary hints; `roster --live --role <role>` is the ROLE-RESOLUTION verb; the `oc-roster --role <role>` form delegates to it and returns byte-identical output |
| `./tools/state/oc-shadow-rotate [--dry-run]` | INTERNAL tail step of `oc-ledger sync` (standalone = manual fallback) |
| `./tools/state/oc-review-persist <lens> <text\|@file\|-> [--dir DIR]` | persist a Duty-6 review report — the index line IS the "persisted" receipt |
| `./tools/smoke/oc-smoke-evidence [--unit opencrabs-ops] [--strings m1,m2] [--negative-control <bin>] [--append-log [<path>]]` | mechanical identity + presence evidence for a Phase 6b smoke verdict; behavioral judgment stays human; `--append-log` is the SANCTIONED writer of the **IDENTITY EVIDENCE BLOCK** in the canonical `smoke-verdicts.log` — the VERDICT ROWS are LANE-AUTHORED (see `upstream-merge-runbook.md` §Upstream-merge cadence · HARVEST LAW · NO-HOLD); bare = the canonical absolute, a wrong path is unrepresentable (M2-2) |
| `./tools/issue/oc-issue-log <issue-n> <sha> [--state <text>] [--repo <slug>] [--dry-run]` | per-commit implementation comment via gh `--body-file` ONLY |
| `./tools/git/oc-commit -m <msg> [--issue N] [--no-comment] [--state <text>] [--repo <path>]` | gated commit wrapper: derives `Issue-Ref` from the actor's latest ledger claim, adds Session-Id + Issue-Ref trailers, folds in the post-commit comment |
| `./tools/ship/oc-ship-audit [--hours N] [--log f] [--journal-dir d] [--grace min]` | dispatch-WITHOUT-swap alarm |
| `./tools/audit/oc-tg-audit <uuid> [--date D] [--days N] [--log-dir P]` | Telegram surface-law evidence scan |
| `./tools/state/oc-ledger sync` CHANGELOG gate | **Exists — HARD (die 6):** a bump whose CHANGELOG entry is missing is refused (v0.4.65, the v0.4.54 backfill incident). **Names what it bundles — WARN (lens C8 extension; Toolsmith disposition accepted 2026-09-22):** the sync also LISTS every commit in its own range that the entry does not name, including those that legitimately carry no issue ref. WARN, never die — the range is other lanes' work, so a hard gate would let one lane's landing block the fleet's version record, and an exclusion list is where this class of gate goes to die. The anchor is the previous sync commit, resolved from its own subject; when it cannot be derived the comparison is SKIPPED with a NOTE, because an unverifiable check must never pass as clean. |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-harvest-census <scan|check|record|sync>` | pre-flight census & lifecycle registry for upstream PR harvests; prevents duplicate/colliding PRs. `record` appends to `manual_records`, which `check` CONSULTS before declaring a unit unharvested — rc 1 `REFUSED … manually recorded as filed in PR #<n> (unit <u>)` — and the registry write MERGES into the loaded dict so foreign keys survive. Use `check`/`scan`, which derive IN_FLIGHT from the live scan |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-harvest-dispatch vet <issue-or-commits>` \| `dispatch <issue> <commits> [--dry-run]` | dispatches automated harvest-to-upstream work order for eligible features |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-harvest-sweep <pr-branch> [--base adolfousier/main] [--repo P] [--port-of sha1,sha2]` | pre-gate harvest verification (harvest Phase 7 sweep, mechanical legs); behavioral judgment stays human |
| `./tools/state/oc-health [--class <name>|--all] [--rotate] [--status] [--json] [--reap] [--quiet] [--selftest]` | 8-class rotating fleet health & cleanliness sweep (owner order 2026-09-11); spec + per-check remediation in `tools/docs/HEALTH-CLASSES.md` & `tools/docs/HEALTH-CHECKS.md`. `--reap` applies SAFE remediations only; without it the tool is a pure read |
| `./tools/state/oc-roster --selftest` | hermetic test runner for roster generation and classification |
| `./tools/audit/oc-watcher-audit [--json] [--notify-orphans]` | detached watcher compliance and sleep-loop audit across active sessions |
| `./tools/git/oc-start <issue-N> --branch <branch>` | unified entry: claim + branch + worktree initialization |
| `./tools/smoke/oc-smoke <issue-N> [--probe <cmd>] [--no-ledger]` | unified 4-leg smoke verification & verdict row logging + automatic ledger done stamp on PASS |
| `./tools/issue/oc-issue-dispatch [--auto]` · `<issue-number> [--to <uuid>] [--force] [--allow-landed] [--redispatch] [--budget-secs N]` | mechanized issue triage dispatch to idle editor lanes; the issue is POSITIONAL and `--to` names the target session — there is NO `--issue` or `--lane` flag (verified live 2026-09-25 against the tool's own `--help` and `tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md` row 36). `--force` overrides the claim gate, `--allow-landed` disables the landed filter, `--redispatch` disables the 7-day dedup window |
| `./tools/state/oc-questions <verb>` | the Open Questions register (#547) — the sanctioned blocked-on-you channel (`fleet-directives.md` §Open Questions Register). Verbs `ask` · `answer` · `amend` · `withdraw` · `notify` · `list` · `publish` · `lint` · `gc` (no `render`: the card/button leg was DELETED by owner order 2026-09-24, because decisions are collected on the PAGE). `ask --factory <KEY>` is REQUIRED and the factory key IS the standing set id; the session and lane are derived from `OPENCRABS_SESSION_ID` plus that session's own binding, so there is no `--lane` to pass and an UNBOUND session is REFUSED non-zero. The page URL is CONSTANT and readable (`questions.l1979.ru/<factory>/`, per-lane anchors `#lane-<slug>`). Full verb/rc/contract register: `tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md` row 49 |
| `./tools/audit/oc-lint-laws [--strict]` | mechanical syntax & tool existence lint of skill markdown laws. **`--strict` known limitation (v0.4.207, measured 2026-09-19; count re-measured 2026-09-25):** `flag_known` demands the flag BE the whole case arm (`^[[:space:]]*--flag)`), so ALTERNATION arms (`--role\|--role=*)`, `--selftest\|selftest)`), INLINE tests (`[ "${1:-}" = "--bundle" ]`) and comments are not recognised. This yields PHANTOM-FLAG **false positives** — **read the count and locations from `oc-lint-laws --strict` itself, which is authoritative and self-updating; do NOT copy them into this row, because the numbers drift on every edit to any corpus file** (measured 2026-09-25: 8 findings, every one of this class and every one naming a real working flag — e.g. `oc-roster --role hq` rc=0, `oc-deploy --selftest` rc=0, and `--bundle`/`--issue` each covered by passing selftest assertions at `tools/state/oc-ledger:1275` and `:1415`). Non-strict mode finds them too. **Do not "fix" these as phantoms** — root fix dispatched to Toolsmith. |
| `./tools/audit/oc-claims-single-source [--scan DIR] [--selftest]` | battery guard: the claim-closure predicate has exactly ONE home (`tools/lib/oc_claims.py`) — fails the battery on a re-added private copy under `tools/`. Keys on the re-implementation SHAPE, never on a name (the two copies it exists to prevent were called `claims_index` and `claim_is_closed`, so a name-keyed guard misses both). Scan units include embedded `python3 -c` / heredoc blobs, not only whole files. rc register: tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-prchecks <branch-or-sha> [--wait N] [--repo SLUG-or-PATH] [--carrier C] [--fault-scope PR]` · `oc-prchecks resume <run-id>` | one-command CI gate on a PR-lane branch (editor.md Phase 5); `wait <ref> [--budget N] [--poll S]` provides single-invocation blocking gate; **`resume <run-id>` RE-ATTACHES to a run this lane WITNESSED** — no dispatch, no adoption (#74 H2) — and is the recovery for a rc-5 in-flight-timeout, whose stdout carries the run id + URL for exactly this (`extra.run_id` in the journal is the same handle). Full rc/adoption/lock/fmt-soft-fail register: tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-upstream-delta [--repo P] [--fork-origin R] [--upstream R]` | watch-cycle arithmetic; READ-ONLY — PROPOSE/WAIT judgment stays human |
| `./tools/git/oc-wt add\|remove\|list` (`--force` is a flag on add/remove) | editor worktree manager (`--force` journals before removal) |
| `./tools/state/oc-drift-check <uuid> [--ack]` (omit-arg canonical; legacy `<uuid> <claimed-ver>` accepted) | editor §Mid-cycle skill drift step 1-2, mechanical |
| `./tools/git/oc-branch-sweep --repo <p> [--dry-run]` | branch-death proof + archive-then-delete for MERGED only |
| `./tools/issue/oc-census` | READ-ONLY pending-branch census (sync runbook Step 7 step 0): decomposes each branch's `git cherry <base> <b>` `+` set into its three arms (own-lane trailer / no trailer / foreign-lane trailer) and ENFORCES the partition identity `plus_total == plus_own + plus_untrailered + plus_other` — a row that fails to add up is an internal error, never a silently-wrong number. A non-zero aggregate `+` is NOT proof of pending work, so it splits the aggregate and runs a CONTENT leg rather than trusting either. Prints counts and the base, never a cut sha. rc register: tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md |
| `./tools/harvest/oc-pr-fault-scope <pr#> --run <id>` | failing-files ∩ PR-files = IN-SCOPE/BASE-FAULT |
| `./tools/state/oc-ledger confirm <uuid>` | verifies the worker's latest claim then flips workers[].confirmed=true |
| `gh workflow run pr-checks.yml --ref ci/quick-build-linux -f ref=<branch-or-sha>` | **manual fallback — prefer `./tools/harvest/oc-prchecks`** (row above). PR-lane CI gates before an upstream PR; yml lives only on the carrier branch |
| `./tools/audit/oc-log-search <pattern> [--log-dir <P>] [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--since <ts>] [--module <re>] [--tail N]` | telemetry-only daemon-log search; HARD FENCE: `brain::provider` lines never match |
| `./tools/ship/oc-ship-chain --sha S --branch B` | CI gate → issue-log → ff-merge → ship → swap in ONE invocation; no-self-ping |
| `./tools/notify/oc-notify-fanout --title T` | per-lane skill-change brief generator; DB-validated forum-scoped targets, receipts + ledger stamp |
| `./tools/git/oc-rebase-safety overlap\|audit` | re-gate split rule arithmetic |
| `./tools/state/oc-roster <live\|forum\|claims\|work\|classify> [--detail\|--json]` | the DERIVED in-progress roster — joins ledger claim events + worktree dirty state + session-DB liveness + forum bindings; stores nothing. `live` = the freeze list; `classify` = ACTIVE/IDLE/ORPHAN/UNKNOWN per row; a claim author absent from the session DB is reported PHANTOM and excluded. `--selftest` = 44 checks. **`--role <role>` is a supported delegation to `oc-ledger roster --live --role <role>` — byte-identical output (verified 2026-09-19, `cmp` rc=0); a bare `--role` with no value answers rc 2.** Sync runbook step 0 |

Tests: `tools/tests/run.sh` — one command, exit 0 only if all pass (the SELFTEST BATTERY — tool
selftests, distinct from the CI-gate CODE TESTS cargo triad). Must stay green before any version
bump; tools are never edited without re-running it.

### Unified tools log

Every tool in `tools/` appends ONE JSONL line on exit. Path, schema, suppression
rules and verified jq recipes: **`tools/docs/RC-CONTRACT.md` §Unified tools log** (sole home).

## Session-notify loop (since v0.3.3)

Editors live in a Telegram forum group: one topic = one editor = one live session = ONE feature.

- **TOPIC NAMES stay in sync with their lane, are `<Area>: <Qualifier>`, and are
  <= 22 characters** (owner order 2026-09-25: "keep the telegram topic names in
  sync. Use short names that would fit into the UI"). A lane that REPURPOSES a
  topic renames it in the SAME turn it repurposes the lane — that pairing is the
  sync the order asks for, and its absence is what left a topic reading
  "streaming-guard-105-xfer" after the lane became the goal owner. The 22-char
  bound is where the owner's CLIENT truncates the sidebar; it was measured by the
  Triage lane on 2026-09-25 and is NOT derivable from this box, so re-derive it
  rather than assume it if the client changes. Mechanism, verified at source:
  `rename_topic` persists through `record_topic_created`
  (`src/channels/telegram/mod.rs:51`) — an append-only INSERT into
  `channel_messages`, never a read-modify-write — so parallel renames cannot
  clobber each other, and a rename keys on `thread_id`, so session bindings are
  unaffected. The live name for a thread is the NEWEST row for that `thread_id`,
  not any row: the table is append-only and retains every historical name.

- Every Editor commit carries a git trailer: `Session-Id: <full session uuid>`
  (`git commit --trailer "Session-Id: <uuid>"`). FULL uuid — the 8-char display
  form cannot drive routing. Each session READS ITS OWN UUID straight from its
  runtime prompt/session context — no lookup tool needed (correction
  2026-08-25); the post-swap fan-out takes notification targets from these
  trailers (`oc-attrib`; `oc-contributors` RETIRED v0.4.72 — E2 #1, subset of oc-attrib, zero live callers).
- After a healthy swap the fan-out is MECHANICAL: `oc-deploy fanout`
  (auto-fired at the `swap_execute` tail since v0.4.37,
  [#24](https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/24)) attributes the
  shipped range and notifies each contributing editor — an editor's job on
  notify is the smoke test (bullets below). GREEN/RED leg internals, range
  math, blame attribution, journal vocabulary: `s2-swap-journal-spec.md`
  §Fan-out legs (re-homed v0.4.80, lens B F4).
- Editors own testing THEIR features on notification: SMOKE TESTS against the
  swapped binary running on this box (the cargo ban itself = editor.md §Box law, one
  statement). Failures funnel back through blame attribution
  (issue #24: `oc-attrib` over Session-Id trailers — mechanical via
  `oc-deploy fanout` since v0.4.37),
  which asks the guilty editors for fixes.
- Separation holds inside the loop: the fan-out notifies + attributes but NEVER
  fixes code; Editors fix + re-push but NEVER attribute others' failures.

### session_notify mechanics — see `session-notify.md`

The `session_notify` TOOL mechanics (same-process scope, delivery-vs-queue-acceptance,
sender identity, per-surface rate limits, refusal handling, the CLI form, and the
`from`-is-a-return-address rule) live in **`session-notify.md`**. The delivery LAW is
canonical at `fleet-directives.md` §Cross-lane message delivery discipline.


### Telegram surface law (v0.4.31)

Inter-role communication is **session_notify ONLY**. No lane ever uses telegram send/edit tools to talk
to another session, another role's topic, the forum General area, an unrelated chat, or the owner DM.

- An Editor's surface is ITS OWN TOPIC and nothing else; normal replies auto-route there as session
  text, the ONLY sanctioned output. Editors NEVER invoke send/edit telegram tools (`telegram_send`,
  `tg_send_message`, `tg_edit_message`, `telegram_edit`) — not even into their own topic; no
  `tg_search_global`/cross-chat reads; `tg_get_messages` limited to the own topic. Reactions are
  allowed (owner consent signal).
- Sanctioned senders (NOT editors — none of this is lane-to-lane): the task-queue skill's documented
  `/tq-approve` flow; alerting lanes reporting to the owner DM per the ops runbook; HQ's session text.
- Violation pattern for HQ: a TOOL_ACCUM row showing an editor lane calling a telegram send/edit
  tool → session_notify the rule; second offense → review toggled.

## Test ontology (v0.4.2 — three kinds + one sanity signal, NEVER conflate)

| | SMOKE TEST | CODE TESTS | FEATURE-PRESENCE CHECK |
|---|---|---|---|
| Answers | does my feature WORK for a user right now? | is the code correct by analysis standards? | is the feature actually INSIDE the artifact we are about to deploy? |
| What | behavioral drive of ONE shipped feature | compile/run verification: cargo fmt, clippy, cargo test | static markers: binary strings/symbols, sha256 identity vs artifact, source-tree grep |
| Where | live `opencrabs-ops` unit, its real surfaces (Telegram, cron, MCP) | GitHub Actions ONLY — the CI gate (`pr-checks.yml`; upstream's own checks on PRs). Carrier build COMPILES the artifact but runs NO test leg (removed 2026-08-31, `e71dba58`) | this box, against the DOWNLOADED artifact + its source tree — nothing running |
| When | after a swap notify (`editor.md` Phase 6b) | pre-flight gate before PRs/ff-merge (Phase 7 step 2c) — `pr-checks.yml` is the ONLY CODE-TESTS locus | pre-swap, every cycle (`oc-deploy` swap path) |
| Who | owning Editor | Editor dispatches the gate and reads conclusions; `oc-deploy` reads build conclusions | `oc-deploy` swap path (pre-S3: Compiler alone) |
| Toolchain | none — local cargo FORBIDDEN in any form (binaries disabled 2026-08-28; editor.md §Box law — canonical, other files reference "(box law)") | CI's own — never local | `strings`, `sha256sum`, `git grep` — none compile anything |
| Evidence | one line: drove X, observed Y (+ run id / sha) | job/step conclusions read via API | marker found/not-found + checksum line in baseline.json |
| On FAIL | issue FIRST, then evidence to the HQ lane (`session_notify`) | fix before merge / PR | NO swap — feature missing from build; regression stated plainly |

The table above carries the ontology. **The smoke-verdict rules and their incident history —
presence-is-not-behaviour, the live-verification stamp for live-testable UX, bookkeeping-legs-are-not-a-pass,
the owner-dependent leg's PARK disposition, the no-log-probe rule for tool-description changes, leg-4
probe hygiene, and the single-sided-probe sufficiency ruling — are canonical at `editor.md`
§Phase 6b (Smoke-verdict rules).** Read them there before writing or judging a verdict.

## Glossary — official terms (v0.4.62; one concept = one name)

- **FIRE** — the release window between version bump and prod swap (editor.md
  usage, lens A8 v0.4.89). In `oc-ledger` cadence output, "FIRE" = the
  Duties-4+6 threshold verdict (≥5 bumps/5 days) — same word, different
  locus; context disambiguates.
- **carrier** — the single build lane: branch `ci/quick-build-linux` + its
  `quick-build-linux.yml` + dispatches from it. workflow_dispatch runs record
  the CARRIER ref/head, never the `-f ref` input; the carrier yml is the
  single source of truth for the prod feature set.
- **fan-out** — the automatic GREEN/RED notify fired at the swap_execute tail
  (`oc-deploy fanout`, idempotent via `fanout.state`).
- **state dir vs skill dir** — the v0.4.60 split: skill repo
  (`skills/opencrabs-dev/`, versioned code+docs) vs state dir
  (`opencrabs-dev/`, runtime). The state dir has NO tools/ — tools always
  resolve next to the invoking script.
  Its content is declared in TWO classes (v0.4.238, a RECOVERABILITY rule: a
  tracked file's only durable record is git):
  - **TRACKED** — `workers-ledger.json` · `journal/` · `oc-deploy/journal/`
    (the deploy audit trail `oc-ledger recover-receipt` reads) · the lane
    `*-state.md` records · `reviews/` · `evidence/` · `tools.log` ·
    `smoke-verdicts.log` · `deployed.sha`/`.meta.json` · `baseline.json` ·
    `fanout.state` · markers (`pacemakers-off`).
  - **GENERATED-IGNORED** — the generated class: `.bak`/`.bak-*` sidecars ·
    `.ledger.*` temps · `__pycache__/` · `*.pyc` · `*.lock`. Never committed,
    reaped on the hygiene cadence WITH a keep-window (a sidecar taken while its
    source was still UNTRACKED is the only copy of that reading).
  A TRACKED class's additions and updates MUST be committed by the state-repo
  commit path. That path has ONE home (#508, 2026-09-22): `STATE_TRACKED_PATHS` +
  `STATE_TRACKED_GLOB` (`tools/state/oc-ledger:223`/`:230`), consumed by
  `state_sweep_tracked` (`:232`), with a selftest asserting the single source
  (`:1540`). BOTH callers sweep the SAME namespace — the auto-commit tail (`:276`)
  and `commit-pending --bundle` (`:1101`). Before #508 the auto-commit staged
  `workers-ledger.json` ALONE and the sweeping verb was invoked by NO enabled cron:
  measured 2026-09-22, 345 entries had piled up on that split. Consequence for
  authorship: a class named TRACKED above is only actually swept if it is in
  `STATE_TRACKED_PATHS` — naming it here without adding it there leaves it
  accumulating while the law reads as covered.
- **single-flight** — the one dispatch/adoption lock serializing concurrent
  oc-prchecks invocations; under it, the newest carrier dispatch is this
  lane's own run.
- **CI gate** — the `pr-checks.yml` dispatch on a worktree/PR head branch:
  fmt (soft-fail) + clippy + all-features test. The ONLY code-test locus.
  Legacy synonyms "CI lint gate" / "lint gate" / "UPSTREAM CI TRIAD GATE"
  all mean THIS gate ("the triad" = fmt/clippy/test); the named rule
  UPSTREAM CI GATE (SKILL.md) is this gate run before any upstream PR.
- **ORDER gates** — the 4 pure-git pre-dispatch checks inside
  `oc-deploy ship` (SHAPE / EXISTENCE / CONTAINMENT / SIGNATURE); no cargo.
- **S2 / S3** — deploy pipeline stages: S2 = sha-bound poll + auto-swap on
  GREEN; S3 = live cutover 2026-08-28 (swap chain mechanical, consent
  eliminated). Rules saying "below S2"/"S3" mean the stage gate.
- **Lane** — one editor session (worker) owning one fork issue + its topic.
  (v0.4.89, lens A7: extended to any role session — Triage/TOOLSMITH/HQ
  lanes exist too; "lane" ≠ editor-only.)
- **disk absorption** — the v0.4.19 worker-update model: skill files are plain
  disk; workers absorb re-reads at their own boundaries (turn start, role-file
  load), no reload pings are owed or sent (defined here lens A16 v0.4.89;
  used in editor.md/triage.md/toolsmith.md).
- **Triage lane** — the interrupt lane carved out of HQ at v0.4.86
  (idea/QUIRK intake, fix routing, enforcement patrols — `triage.md`); never
  edits skill files. Discover its session via `session_search`, never
  uuid-from-memory.
- **Toolsmith lane** — the CLI tool lane carved out at v0.4.87 (owner "Go toolsmith"
  2026-09-06): owns `tools/` code — makes + fixes the CLI tools every other role
  uses (`toolsmith.md`); never edits skill markdown. Discover its session via
  `session_search`, never uuid-from-memory.
- **Roster** — the worker registry in `workers-ledger.json` (enroll / claim /
  ack rows); `oc-attrib` joins Session-Id trailers against it.
- **Lens (Reviewer A–J)** — one Duty-6 read-only review perspective
  (hq.md §Duty 6; full briefs: `review-lenses.md`).
- **HQ** — the skill-owning lane. The former name *Supervisor* is RETIRED
  (owner order 2026-09-11 folded the term into HQ — one role, one term);
  unofficial variants ("Author lane", "Carrier") seen in lane files are also
  retired — lens A-L3 v0.4.116.
- **Selftest** — a tool's built-in test mode (`oc-deploy --selftest` etc.);
  **battery** — `tools/tests/run.sh` across all tools. Both green before
  ANY version bump.
- **GREEN / RED** — a GitHub Actions run conclusion read by terminal truth
  (`gh run view --json conclusion`), never exit-code inference.
- **TOOL_ACCUM** — the per-session tool-usage rows accumulated in the unified
  tools log; evidence base for Telegram surface-law audits (triage.md Duty T4
  — ex hq.md Duty 7).
- **PARKED-OWNER-EYE** — non-blocking smoke row state (v0.4.152) stamped when
  the sole remaining behavioral evidence requires the human owner (visual pass,
  tap, UI inspection); frees the lane to continue or complete without blocking.
- **4-Leg Smoke Rubric** — the mandatory verification standard (v0.4.104) for
  shipping candidates: (1) Lineage (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), (2) Identity
  (`oc-smoke-evidence` artifact checksum), (3) CI Gate (GREEN run on head sha),
  (4) Behavioral Probe (executing live binary path or structural N/A). All four
  must pass before an upstream PR leaves a lane.
- **issue cluster** — the harvest unit: fork-only commits grouped by their
  canonical issue ref, filtered on the ISSUE TITLE for fix-type. The dependency
  leg is the **UNION of TWO graphs** (owner ruling 2026-09-25) — the COMMIT/FILE
  graph AND the gh relationship graph — and they do NOT behave alike. The file
  graph is unusable as a set former: transitive closure of file overlap over the
  live delta collapses to **3 components (159+1+1)**, so only **1-HOP** file
  overlap is a leg. The gh relationship graph is sparse and semantic (138 edges
  over 123 sets carrying delta work, 21 non-trivial, largest 11 members) but is
  structurally weak while parent-linking is unenforced — 13 of 55 open fix-titled
  clusters carry a parent (23.6%). A set is **READY** iff (a) the most recent swap
  among its ready members is >24h ago AND (b) it has **no unready members**, where
  ready = swapped + smoked + **closed** — so an open own-issue holds its own set.
  Defined by
  `tools/harvest/oc-harvest-census clusters`, which derives it and emits every
  cluster (never pages silently); the soak gate keys on it and Triage surfaces
  by it. NOT "convergence cluster" (a Duty-4/6 group of rule proposals merged
  into one law change) and NOT a retired freeze T-group (the register was
  removed 2026-09-24); the bare word "cluster" in harvest law always means
  this one.

## Red-run triage heuristics (shared core)

ONE location: `editor.md` §Red-run triage heuristics (moved v0.4.262). Read by the editor in its
fix round and by HQ in RED triage — fix unresolved-name/import errors FIRST, count brace DEPTH not
brace counts, give an inner match its own exhaustive arms, and **settle contradictory INCOMING
verdicts via the live GH API before acting** (even ACKs can be stale).

## Shared environment facts (all roles)

**Full text: `environment.md`.** The load-bearing facts, inline so a cold session cannot miss them:

- **No local cargo — EVER.** This box has no sanctioned Rust toolchain; CI is the only
  sanctioned compile/test executor (Box law, `editor.md §Box law`). No `cargo`/`rustc`/`clippy`
  in any form — install, PATH-prepend, explicit path, or an invocation that exits 0.
- **`gh` in `~/opencrabs` defaults to UPSTREAM.** `-R`/`--repo` is MANDATORY for any
  fork-targeted read or write; an unscoped call returns a real but WRONG issue or 404s.
- **`origin` = fork `leshchenko1979/opencrabs`** (push target + issues home) · **`adolfousier`** = upstream (PRs only).
- **Actor attribution is automatic** via ambient `OPENCRABS_SESSION_ID`.

Everything else — the skill glob gate's exact matching semantics, branch namespaces, the
carrier/feature-set/dispatch rules, and the daemon facts — is in `environment.md`.


## Upstream relations (v0.4.0, owner-approved 2026-08-26)

Upstream movement is WATCHED and ABSORBED on a schedule per the matrix below:

| Lifecycle Area | Owning Role | Key Tool / Procedure | Canonical Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Upstream Delta Watch** | Triage | `./tools/harvest/oc-upstream-delta` | `triage.md §Duty T4` |
| **2. Sync Model (REBASE)** | Triage | `upstream-merge-runbook.md` | `upstream-merge-runbook.md §Remotes & sync` |
| **3. Absorption & Dropping** | Triage / HQ | Auto-classify DROPPABLE patch-ids | `upstream-merge-runbook.md` |
| **4. Upstream PR Lifecycle** | HARVEST | Phase 7b / Phase 7c (`oc-harvest-dispatch`) | `harvest.md` |
| **5. Maintainer Interaction** | HQ / Alexey | Track PR comments via gh API & OC Dev chat heads-up | `harvest.md §Deep Core Advance Heads-Up Gate` |
| **6. Fork-local CI (`ci/*`)** | HQ | Carrier namespace `ci/quick-build-linux` | `hq.md §Upstream sync — watch & governance` |
| **7. Fork Branch Lifecycle** | Triage | `./tools/git/oc-branch-sweep` (archive before delete) | `triage.md §Duty T4` |

## Hard rules (all roles)

- Reports to Alexey: every issue/PR reference
  carries the LINK behind the number (issues: `https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/N`
  — the fork is the issues home; PRs: `https://github.com/adolfousier/opencrabs/pull/N`) — a bare `#N` is never enough.
- Refer to workers by TOPIC/CHAT NAME only (owner 2026-08-31) — NEVER by session uuid, on EVERY
  surface (owner reports, inter-lane advisories, session_notify text, verdict tables, ledger
  commentary). Uuids are for ROUTING fields only (`target_session`, `OC_ACTOR`, `Session-Id`
  trailers, tool arguments). Test: the owner must know WHICH chat to open without a lookup.
- Stick to the OFFICIAL ONTOLOGY (owner 2026-08-31): all roles use the vocabulary this SKILL
  defines — test ontology (§Test ontology), infra terms (§Glossary: selftest/battery/CI gate),
  roles (Editor/HQ/Triage/Toolsmith/Harvest/Reviewer lenses), gate colors (GREEN/RED with run
  receipt), phases, tool names. No ad-hoc synonyms; a NEW concept is proposed via the poll format
  and named on owner word. Reviewer A (REDUNDANCY + ONTOLOGY) enforces this lens-side.
- **Context Manifest Curation (Compaction Section 10, owner order 2026-09-17):** when context compaction occurs, the compactor MUST explicitly retain `opencrabs-dev`, `opencrabs-dev/fleet-directives.md`, and the active role file (`opencrabs-dev/editor.md`, `opencrabs-dev/hq.md`, `opencrabs-dev/triage.md`, `opencrabs-dev/toolsmith.md`, or `opencrabs-dev/harvest.md`) in `active_skills`. Only non-active role files are placed in `discard_skills`. Essential tools (`session_notify`, `session_search`, `bash`, `read_file`, `telegram_send`) must stay pre-activated. Canonical: `fleet-directives.md §Post-compaction skill reload & context manifest curation`.
- ONLY HQ edits skill files: `SKILL.md` · `editor.md` · `harvest.md` · `hq.md` · `triage.md` · `toolsmith.md` ·
  `review-lenses.md` · `fleet-directives.md` · `upstream-merge-runbook.md` · `war-stories.md` ·
  `s2-swap-journal-spec.md` · `README.md` · `CHANGELOG.md` · `tools/docs/*.md` — including all worker lanes AND
  the TRIAGE and TOOLSMITH lanes (2026-08-26; Compiler retired 2026-08-28). Workers propose via poll format or
  direct notify; they never write. ONE exception: `tools/**` CODE is the TOOLSMITH lane's (v0.4.87 carve-out),
  shipped with battery receipts — README's tool-fleet section and `tools/docs/*.md` count as that surface; the
  rest of README and all skill markdown stay HQ-only.
- Relay only PREDICATED claims (v0.4.6, from fabrication deviation #3): any
  build/deploy/artifact claim you pass onward must carry evidence YOU verified
  same-turn — run id against the API, sha against `ls-remote`/job-name embed,
  binary against sha256. A claim verified by someone else's message is
  unverified.
- ISSUE ROUTING (owner directives 2026-08-25 → 2026-08-27; consolidated as a
  table 2026-08-29):

| Rule | Applies to | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| NEW issues NEVER upstream — every new issue (upstream-code bugs and fork-only infra alike) is filed on the FORK | `leshchenko1979/opencrabs` | owner 2026-08-27 14:08Z |
| Upstream receives PRs ONLY — body = detailed description ending `Original issue: <full fork URL>`; NEVER `Closes #N` (wrong issue space) | `adolfousier/opencrabs` PR bodies | owner 2026-08-27 |
| Fork issue closed by US right after the PR is filed | fork issue tracker | — |
| Fork issues NEVER claimed on GitHub: no tackling comments, assignment, labels/reactions by any lane — claiming = `Issue-Ref` trailer + workers-ledger `claim` row (kind `claim`, v1.1 vocabulary since v0.4.48); uniqueness sweeps stay read-only search | ledger | owner 2026-08-27 17:07Z |
| PR SHIPMENT — **PR SHIPMENT LAW (single home): feature COMPLETE + smoke PASS (v0.4.104 four-leg rubric) → the EDITOR posts smoke evidence to its forum topic and its obligation ENDS there; the HARVEST lane ports, gates and files the upstream PR. All other references to this law are pointers to THIS row — procedure: `harvest.md` Phase 7; upstream-merge-runbook.md §Upstream-merge cadence (harvest census); triage.md T4.** | mechanical gates | standing process |
| APPROVAL = Alexey's reply or a positive Telegram reaction to the explicit request in the forum topic; silence is NOT consent; spontaneous / ad-hoc PRs remain forbidden | owner word | v0.4.1 |

*Pre-2026-08-27 upstream issues stay readable for uniqueness sweeps and legacy
links; development-time upstream contact is PR-comments only (supersedes the
2026-08-22 issues/comment rule).*
- CONSENT REGISTER — **Never rule from codified memory — grep the live record
  (chat / ledger) before denying any permission** (v0.4.17 lesson, 2026-08-26).
  Deploy consent RETIRED 2026-08-28 (owner 18:50Z): GREEN carrier run + artifact
  verify IS the authorization. Upstream-PR filing follows the PR SHIPMENT law (PR SHIPMENT row, the ISSUE ROUTING bullet above), GATED BY THE MODE REGISTER below. APPROVAL
  definition above governs everything that is owner-gated (silence is NOT consent).
  - **MODE REGISTER — the upstream-PR filing gate is a MODE SWITCH (owner ruling 2026-09-20).** Two modes, ONE declared current, and the switch is the OWNER's alone. Owner's words: *"we basically have two modes: 1. High-trust mode, when I'm sure that the factory is working so that the quality allows autonomous harvesting. 2. Degraded, like now, when I want to gate every PR group."*

    | Dimension | HIGH-TRUST MODE | DEGRADED MODE |
    |---|---|---|
    | Condition (owner's words) | "the factory is working ... quality allows autonomous harvesting" | "I want to gate every PR group" |
    | Upstream PR filing | lane files on the 4-leg smoke PASS; filing NOTICE to its own topic | **the PR GROUP is HELD for explicit owner approval before the PR leaves the lane** |
    | Approval form | not required — SMOKE PASS is the gate | owner reply, or a positive Telegram reaction to the explicit request; **silence is NOT consent** |
    | Filing unit | one feature PR, per lane | **PR GROUP** — related PRs approved together |
    | Smoke rubric / CI gate / rollback | 4 legs / unchanged / owner's call | 4 legs / unchanged / owner's call |

    **CURRENT MODE: DEGRADED.** Resolution is LIVE, never remembered: read the newest `MODE:` row via `oc-ledger events --n 2000 --kind note` — **`--n` is MANDATORY, because `events` is a TAIL whose default window is ~21 rows, so a bare `events --kind note` returns an EMPTY result that is INDISTINGUISHABLE from "no `MODE:` row exists"** (the sole MODE row sat ~590 rows back and was invisible to the bare form; measured 2026-09-22T20:1xZ, and it had already produced two "no MODE row, therefore DEGRADED" findings in durable records that were RIGHT only because the law fails closed). **If NO `MODE:` row exists the default is DEGRADED** (fail closed — holding a filing costs nothing, an unapproved filing is a public act). **Under DEGRADED the harvest hold is GLOBAL**: it supersedes the retired per-group Owner Push Freeze register (removed by owner order 2026-09-24 21:04Z — see `fleet-directives.md` §Owner Push Freeze — RETIRED), so no PR group of ANY feature is filed without explicit owner approval. A feature's soak maturing, a green census, or an idle editor is never a release. The owner switches by word, receipted by `oc-ledger stamp note "MODE: <HIGH-TRUST|DEGRADED> — <provenance>" --by "hq <uuid>"`. Procedure: `harvest.md` §Phase 7 step 0a.
  (Deleted-tool history: CHANGELOG.md.)
- ROLE-SCOPED BROADCASTS: messages reach non-owning roles ONLY when tagged
  [ALL]; otherwise send strictly to the owning role. CC-everyone is noise.
- ONE formal SMOKE verdict per editor-feature lane: exactly one PASS/FAIL;
  duplicate confirmations are noise (#1227 lane double-report, 2026-08-26).
- SMOKE-EVIDENCE PRECEDENCE (v0.4.18): prefer
  smoke tests verifiable from LOGS over those requiring human verification.
  A machine-checkable verdict — CI run conclusion via API, parsed build/test
  logs, captured runtime or endpoint output — outranks "a human said it
  passed"; request human confirmation ONLY where logs genuinely cannot cover
  the claim (visual rendering, interactive UX), and then name EXACTLY what to
  observe. Design smoke captures to be self-sufficient: every claim cites run
  id + sha + step evidence, so any verdict is re-derivable from logs alone. Source-precedence ranks EVIDENCE quality only - it never conflates kinds: a green CI/build log stays CODE-TEST/build evidence and substitutes nothing for a behavioral SMOKE pass.
- UPSTREAM CI GATE (v0.4.22; encodes
  adolfousier/opencrabs CONTRIBUTING.md): NO upstream PR leaves a lane until
  the owning worktree passed the CI gate — and since v0.4.28 CI is the only
  executor, never local (Box law; local cargo in ANY form is a violation;
  Compiler role RETIRED 2026-08-28). The
  evidence is the GREEN `pr-checks.yml` run on the PR head branch (fmt/clippy/
  `cargo test --locked --profile ci --all-features` — flags VERBATIM from
  pr-checks.yml) — canonical procedure:
  harvest.md §Phase 7 step 2c. One red = fix cycle, not a filed
  PR ("PRs that fail CI will not be reviewed" — their words). Receipts ride
  the PR prep beside smoke evidence. Gate covers shipworthiness only;
  the SMOKE pass remains a required condition in BOTH modes, and owner approval
  is required under **DEGRADED MODE** and waived under **HIGH-TRUST MODE**
  (§Hard rules — CONSENT REGISTER / MODE REGISTER).
- Issue-first, no exceptions (2026-08-25): a DISCOVERED problem gets its issue
  FILED before any fix work starts — on the FORK `leshchenko1979/opencrabs`
  (ALL new issues — upstream-code bugs and fork-only infra alike; upstream
  receives PRs only). Discoverer
  files it (symptom + evidence); fixer claims via an `oc-ledger claim` row +
  an `Issue-Ref` trailer on the commit — NO `gh` comment, assignment or label
  on the fork issue (fork-issue comments are the owner's lane only,
  2026-08-27). Covers
  task starts (`editor.md` Phase 1) AND mid-loop finds: red-build bugs, failed
  smoke tests, defects in another editor's feature.
- Continuous Issue Relationship Linking (owner order 2026-09-16): whenever a parent
  subsystem relationship, blocker dependency, or child sub-issue is established or discovered
  at ANY point in the lifecycle (creation, triage intake, editor in-flight discovery, decomposition,
  or upstream PR staging), the lane identifying it MUST establish native links in the same turn
  via `gh issue edit <issue> --parent <parent-issue>` and/or `gh issue edit <issue> --add-blocked-by <blocker-issue>`.
  **READ a relation with `gh issue view <N> --json parent,subIssues,blockedBy,blocking` (or the
  `/parent` endpoint) — NEVER via the issue object's `.parent` projection.** `gh api
  repos/O/R/issues/N --jq '.parent.number'` returns a confident **null for every issue**, including
  ones that demonstrably have a parent, because the REST issue object does not carry that field; the
  same call returns a real title and state, so the null is indistinguishable from "no parent". It has
  already produced one recorded false negative (ledger n=11340) and defeated a GUARD that used it to
  skip already-parented issues — a verification instrument and a guard need the same authority, so one
  correct read at the end does not protect a wrong read at the gate.
- Restart scope: **`opencrabs-ops` ONLY.** The `family` and default-profile daemons
  require Alexey's explicit approval EVERY time. Exception (v0.4.71, lens B2 #3;
  sanctioned v0.4.59 #47): HQ may mechanically restart the
  `opencrabs-family.service` SIDECAR (journal-sequence verified) — never the
  default-profile daemon.
- Never trust watcher exit codes alone — read the run's own `conclusion` via API.
- BUILD TRIGGERS = exactly TWO, NO exceptions (v0.4.3, S3-rewired 2026-08-28; A3 owner ruling 2026-08-29): an editor's `oc-deploy ship --sha <full-sha>` background task, or Alexey's word. No other dispatch — the direct PR-head dispatch is retired (superseded by `oc-prchecks`; ORDER gate 3 containment rejects any sha outside fork `main` anyway). All builds serialize under single-flight.

## Shared war stories (why these rules exist)

Incident histories behind the hard rules live in `war-stories.md` (history is reference, not
procedure; the version-level record is `CHANGELOG.md`).
