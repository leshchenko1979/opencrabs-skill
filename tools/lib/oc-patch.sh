# =============================================================================
# lib/oc-patch.sh — content identity for a rebased commit (Duty-4 n=2520)
# =============================================================================
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A lane's branch goes non-FF when fork main advances (the merge race). The
#   lane rebases, the content is byte-identical, but the COMMIT SHA CHANGES. The
#   CI gate is pinned to a sha, so a GREEN gate is voided by construction and
#   the lane pays a second full gate (~30 min) over bytes that never moved.
#   Measured 2026-09-25: ONE patch, THREE shas, THREE full gates —
#     47e615d9e -> run 36141969856, 9377c6a06 -> run 36144454832,
#     7f83ba97d -> run 36149339727
#   and all three carry the SAME patch-id b34db1c21bcd6fe1b537be2423324fd8822bceb7.
#   So "same patch, different sha" is a decidable question, and this is the
#   predicate that decides it.
#
# WHY patch-id AND NOT `cmp`
#   `git patch-id --stable` hashes a commit's own patch with line numbers and
#   whitespace normalised, so it is invariant to where the commit lands and to
#   the surrounding context a rebase rewrites. It is ALSO already the fleet's
#   content predicate: oc-rebase-safety compares per-file patch-ids
#   (tools/git/oc-rebase-safety, the SAME/CHANGED arms) to decide whether a
#   rebase lost a hunk. This lib gives that same predicate ONE home rather than
#   a second copy — the oc-claims-single-source rule.
#
# FAIL CLOSED
#   An uncomputable patch-id (root commit, merge commit, sha absent from the
#   local object store) is NEVER a match. A predicate that cannot observe its
#   own subject must not return "same" — that would carry a gate forward over
#   content nobody verified, which is the exact silent-clean class this fleet
#   keeps closing.
