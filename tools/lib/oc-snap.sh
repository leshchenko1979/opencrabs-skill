# oc-snap.sh — run a long-running tool from an immutable MIRROR of tools/.
#
# WHY: bash does not hold a script in memory. It reads from the file by byte
# offset as it goes, so an in-place rewrite (truncate + write, inode preserved
# — what both write_file and edit_file do, and what git checkout/pull do too)
# makes the interpreter's saved offset land in the NEW content. It resumes
# mid-line and executes whatever is there: silent death, and a false-success rc
# when the caller reads a pipe's status instead.
#
# Incident + evidence: leshchenko1979/opencrabs#167
# Design + probe receipts:
#   ~/.opencrabs/profiles/ops/projects/toolsmith-167/files/design-inplace-rewrite-guard.md
#
# USAGE — as the first executable lines of a long-running tool, directly under
# the shebang and BEFORE `set -e`/`set -u` and before any lib is sourced:
#
#   _OC_SNAP="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)/lib/oc-snap.sh"
#   if [ -f "$_OC_SNAP" ]; then . "$_OC_SNAP"; oc_snap_guard "$0" "$@"; fi
#
# oc_snap_guard either EXECs (it never returns in that case) or returns 0 with
# the tool running from an immutable copy. It never aborts a run: any failure
# falls back to running directly, with a warning on stderr.
#
# Env: OC_SNAP_ROOT (mirror root, default /tmp), OC_SNAP_DEPTH (internal).

  # re-opens the very hole this guard closes. tools/ is 824K / 46 files, so the
  # copy is cheap; a new inode for every entry is the whole point.

# Reap mirrors whose owning process is gone. Trap-based cleanup cannot be used:
# the tools install their own EXIT trap (trap 'oc_log_finish $?' EXIT), which
# would overwrite ours. The health sweep calls this too; it is idempotent.
#
# A mirror is named oc-snap-<tool>-<pid>, where <pid> is the TOP-LEVEL guard
# process. That process forks children (e.g. oc-deploy poll,
# oc-carrier-features --fetch) which inherit the mirror path in their argv but
# carry their OWN pids -- so a dead name-pid does NOT prove the mirror is
# unused. Both conditions must hold before removal:
#   (1) the name pid is gone, AND
#   (2) no live process references the mirror path in its argv.
# Age is deliberately NOT a criterion: a chain legitimately holds its mirror for
# 30+ minutes, and an age-based sweep would pull it out from under a live run --
# the exact failure class this guard exists to prevent (fork #167).
# Prints the number of mirrors removed on stdout.
