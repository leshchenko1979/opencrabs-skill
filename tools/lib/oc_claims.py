"""oc_claims.py — THE canonical claim-closure predicate (issues #305, #313, #314).

ONE implementation, imported by every tool that asks "is this claim still open?".

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Four copies of this predicate had drifted apart across
`oc-harvest-dispatch` (#305), `oc-issue-dispatch` (#309), `oc-roster` and
`oc-ledger` (#313). They did not merely differ in style:

  * two copies extracted issue tokens as INTEGERS, two as STRINGS, and each
    compared tokens against its own type — so on a ledger mixing both, one
    copy's `tok in e['tokens']` was silently always-False (a claim could never
    close) while another's was silently always-True-able;
  * only one copy asked WHO authored the closing row. The others treated any
    lane's closing event that merely MENTIONED `#N` in prose as closing every
    lane's claim on `#N` — which reported an ACTIVE lane as IDLE and bypassed
    the in-flight fencing that stops a patrol double-dispatching live work
    (#305);
  * conversely, a CROSS-LANE standdown addressed to `#N` (`STANDDOWN #269
    (52058a75)`, stamped by Triage) closed nothing at all, so a shipped,
    stood-down claim stayed OPEN until its claimant hand-stamped a redundant
    closure row (#313, live row n=7803 / n=8055).

Import from a tool (bash-embedded python included):

    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'lib'))
    import oc_claims as oc

THE CANONICAL RULE — a claim on `#N` is CLOSED by a LATER event whose kind is
in CLOSING_KINDS and which satisfies ANY of:

  1. it is authored by the SAME lane as the claim, and references `#N`; or
  2. it is ADDRESSED to `#N` — its `what` begins `#N` (optionally after the
     `STANDDOWN ` keyword). Administrative sweeps
     (`#N — closed-issue stale claim sweep`) and a lane's own `#N COMPLETE`
     rows take this form, and their author is by design NOT the claimant; or
  3. the claim's author is UNATTRIBUTED (the `(unattributed` /
     `unrostered-actor` sentinels) — there is no actor to discriminate on, so
     ANY later closer referencing `#N` closes it.

Signal 2 is deliberately NARROW: `what` must BEGIN with the reference. A
foreign lane's closing row that merely mentions `#N` in prose — `UNCLAIM #264 —
stood down in favour of editor lane X` — must NOT close another lane's claim.
That row releases its AUTHOR's own claim, and by naming X it in fact confirms X
still holds it (#305).

NO REGEX OVER `what` AS A WHOLE. Issue references are extracted by TOKEN, never
by substring and never by "first run of digits": a date (`2026-09-15`), the
owner handle (`leshchenko1979`), a commit sha or a session-uuid prefix must not
be read as an issue number (#272), and `claims 76` must not match a claim on
`#760` (c6b1a539 residual).

WHAT A CLAIM CLAIMS (#329). Reference extraction answers TWO different
questions, and one token list must not serve both:

  * "does this row REFERENCE `#N`?" — every FORK-space reference counts. A
    closing row's prose mention of `#N` is part of signal 1 (same author,
    references `#N`), so :func:`issue_ref_tokens` deliberately keeps them all —
    all of them that name a fork issue. A reference qualified by another
    repository is upstream space and is skipped in BOTH predicates (#379).
  * "does this row CLAIM `#N`?" — only the row's ADDRESS counts. A `what` is a
    SENTENCE: the issues it cites while explaining itself are context, not
    claims. Live instance — row `n=8226` claims #327 and its note ends `...
    one proven live break (#323)`; reading that mention as a claim registered a
    PHANTOM claim on #323, which then made `oc-ledger sweep-closed-claims` want
    to write a false unclaim row and made `oc-issue-dispatch` report an OPEN
    issue as taken. 13 such phantoms existed fleet-wide.

:func:`primary_issue_tokens` is that second predicate: the leading reference
CLUSTER — starting at the first reference and continuing while further
references are joined only by list punctuation (`,`, `/`, `+`, `&`) or
whitespace. Prose separates, list punctuation does not, so a genuine
multi-issue claim survives (`CLAIM #193, #205 — harvest packaging`) while a
citation in the body drops out. Measured over the live ledger: of the 37 claim
rows carrying more than one reference, 35 change target under this rule, NONE
becomes target-less, and the one deliberate dual claim is preserved.

NEW ROWS CARRY THE ANSWER. `oc-ledger claim`/`stamp claim` records the targets
as a structured `issues` array on the row, so a claim written from now on is
never re-derived from prose at all; :func:`primary_issue_tokens` is the
fallback for rows written before that field existed.

CLAIM FOOTPRINT (#307). The ledger raises a SECOND question alongside closure —
"which FILES does the claimed work touch?" — and that answer had drifted into
two more unanchored copies (one in `oc-harvest-census`, one in
`oc-harvest-dispatch`). Both resolved it by grepping commit messages for the
bare text `#N` (`git log -n 10 --grep=#N` in one, a substring test over
subjects and trailers in the other), so a commit whose PROSE merely mentioned
`#N` was read as work on `#N`. Closure and footprint are different questions
with different predicates; this module owns both, so a fifth and sixth copy
cannot appear. Footprint is anchored to the `Issue-Ref` TRAILER — the
machine-written link `oc-commit` derives from the actor's ledger claim — and
scoped to fork space: see :func:`resolve_issue_commits`.

READ-ONLY. This module never writes the ledger; the sweep's write path lives in
`oc-ledger` and goes through the sanctioned `stamp` verb.

WRITE-TIME CONSUMER. `oc-ledger`'s own `_issue_ref_tokens` shell helper now
delegates here rather than carrying a fifth copy of the pattern. That one sits
on the WRITE path (`stamp claim`'s dead-letter guard, and `claim-ref`, which
derives an issue from the very text `claims` scans), so a drifting copy there
does not merely mis-report — it lets the tool write a claim the scanner cannot
see, or derive an issue the scanner never wrote. Agreement is the point.
