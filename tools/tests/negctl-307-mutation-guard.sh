# Mutation guards for #307 and #365 — prove the negative controls are LIVE, not
# vacuous.
#
# A negative control that cannot fail is decoration. Each section reverts one
# shipped behaviour on a COPY of the tools tree and requires the selftests to
# FAIL on that copy while the unmutated copy stays green. If a control passes
# under the mutant, it is not testing what it claims to.
#
# #307 — anchored Issue-Ref fencing. Reverts the matcher to the pre-#307
# unanchored `git log --grep=#N`. Covers all three control sites:
#   (1) tools/oc-harvest-census --selftest
#   (2) tools/oc-harvest-dispatch --selftest   (legs 11e/11f)
#   (3) tools/tests/run.sh §00c lib/oc_claims unit cases
#
# #365 — the gate-4 SUBJECT predicate (symbol derivation + the declared-subject
# fallback). §4 reverts that predicate four ways, one per gate-4 shape, and
# requires the shape's own leg to be the FIRST failure on its mutant. The legs
# abort the suite on first failure, so "first bad leg == the leg aimed at" is
# the strongest assertion available without splitting the suite.
#
# Harness guards (AGENTS.md §Repro harnesses): explicit tool path, recursion
# guard, process budget cap.
