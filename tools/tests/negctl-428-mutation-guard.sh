# Mutation guard for #428 — prove the close-keyword scan's legs are LIVE, not
# vacuous.
#
# #428: `oc-commit` handed the caller's `-m` bodies to `git commit` verbatim and
# inspected none of them. GitHub's default-branch parser closes an issue when a
# body carries a close keyword followed by #N, and it CANNOT read negation — so
# the honest-limit prose the process itself requires ("Part B alone does NOT fix
# #321") closed fork issue #321 ELEVEN SECONDS after the ff-merge, with no
# upstream PR at all. The fix adds a scoped, NON-BLOCKING scan that warns on
# stderr, naming the matched shape and classifying it.
#
# A leg that cannot fail is decoration. Each section reverts ONE shipped
# property on a COPY of the tools tree and requires `oc-commit --selftest` to
# fail on that copy while the unmutated copy stays green.
#
# ASSERTION SHAPE — oc-commit's selftest ABORTS at the first failing leg
# (`exit 1`), unlike oc-health which counts and continues. So exactly ONE
# `selftest: <label>` line can exist per mutant, and the strongest available
# assertion is: the mutant fails, and the FIRST (hence only) failing leg is the
# leg aimed at. The cost of that shape is shadowing, stated rather than hidden:
# a mutation that reddens leg 8a's first assertion also hides 8a's later ones
# and all of 8b/8c behind it. Every aimed leg below is therefore reachable as a
# FIRST failure under its own mutant — that is the property this guard asserts,
# and it is why `#428-clean-silent` (8b) is deliberately NOT claimed: with 8a
# ahead of it, no faithful mutation can reach it first.
#
# Standalone by design — the negctl-* family is not wired into
# tools/tests/run.sh; it is run deliberately when the legs it guards change.
#
# Harness guards (AGENTS.md §Repro harnesses): explicit tool path, recursion
# guard, process budget cap, timeout.
