# Mutation guard for #426 — prove the two unset-direction legs are LIVE, not
# vacuous.
#
# #426: `oc-health` class 5 chose its verdict direction from the ABSENCE of a
# hand-made marker (`<state dir>/pacemakers-off`), so "the owner lifted the
# order" and "the marker was never written" were byte-identical to the check.
# With the marker absent in every profile it re-reported the owner's own
# 2026-09-18 pacemakers-off order back to him as `8 QUIRK cron-disabled` on
# every run. The fix routes the absent case to a NOTES channel: observed and
# surfaced, never counted as a finding, so rc stays 0.
#
# A leg that cannot fail is decoration. Each section reverts ONE shipped
# property on a COPY of the tools tree and requires `oc-health --selftest` to
# fail on that copy while the unmutated copy stays green. Unlike the census
# selftest (which aborts at the first bad leg), oc-health COUNTS failures and
# runs on, so this guard asserts the strongest available property: the mutant
# reddens EXACTLY the legs aimed at, and no unrelated leg.
#
# Standalone by design — the negctl-* family is not wired into
# tools/tests/run.sh; it is run deliberately when the legs it guards change.
#
# Harness guards (AGENTS.md §Repro harnesses): explicit tool path, recursion
# guard, process budget cap, timeout.
