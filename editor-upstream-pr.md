# Editor upstream PR procedure — Phase 7 + 7b (split from editor.md, v0.4.131)

## Phase 7 — Feature complete → upstream PR

Trigger: the feature is COMPLETE — merged into fork `main`, shipped inside a
green swapped build, smoke test PASS (v0.4.104 four-leg rubric). With tests green
and smoke confirmed, Editor prepares the harvested PR branch, posts the smoke
evidence, and files the upstream PR. Development-time contact stays issues-only;
this PR is the ONE sanctioned exception (completed features only).

```bash
# 0a. MODE GATE (v0.4.226) — resolve the current mode LIVE, never from memory:
#       tools/oc-ledger events --kind note | grep -o 'MODE: [A-Z-]*' | head -1
#     NO `MODE:` row => DEGRADED (fail closed).
#       DEGRADED   -> HOLD the PR GROUP. Request owner approval in YOUR forum topic
#                     (reply or a positive reaction = approval; silence is NOT consent).
#                     File only on that approval.
#       HIGH-TRUST -> proceed to step 0b; the 4-leg smoke PASS is the gate.
# 0b. FILING NOTICE: post the smoke-test EVIDENCE + the filing report in
#    YOUR forum topic (what you drove, what you saw, run id + built sha + PR URL).

# 1. list fork-only commits, pick THIS feature's (trailers + touched files)
#    — mechanized: `tools/oc-attrib --range <old>..<new> --contributors` (3-col TSV:
#    session-uuid / issue_refs / sha7s) or `tools/oc-attrib --range` for
#    roster-resolved roles; the raw form:
git -C ~/opencrabs fetch adolfousier
git -C ~/opencrabs log --format='%H%x09%s%x09%(trailers:key=Session-Id,valueonly)' \
  adolfousier/main..origin/main

# 2. harvest onto a branch off UPSTREAM main — NEW worktree, usual hygiene
#    (E1, v0.4.80: `oc-wt add --create` IS the sanctioned creation path.
#     The old "oc-wt never creates" raw `worktree add -b` ritual taught a
#     false interface fact; use `--create` unless that flag is unavailable.)
tools/oc-wt add up-<feature> leshchenko1979/<feature> --create --from adolfousier/main --repo ~/opencrabs
git -C ~/oc-wt-up-<feature> cherry-pick <sha1> <sha2> ...
# 2-fresh. BASE FRESHNESS before the gate dispatch (Duty-4 P4, v0.4.80;
#         AMENDED v0.4.93 — scope NARROWED to pre-filing only, owner "go all"
#         2026-09-07 on the Adolfo-protocol amendment):
git -C ~/opencrabs fetch adolfousier
git -C ~/opencrabs rev-parse adolfousier/main   # must equal the sha the port was cut from
#    upstream moved since the port? RE-PORT onto the new base — BEFORE filing.
#    SCOPE (v0.4.93): applies ONLY while the work is fork-internal (branch,
#    gate, pre-filing). Once the upstream PR is FILED, the PR-freeze law
#    (below) takes over: NO re-port, NO force-push, NO head/body changes —
#    a filed PR is frozen regardless of upstream main movement. Conflict
#    resolution after filing is the MAINTAINER's side of the wall (merge
#    locally, fix on top, push, comment). Post-merge, upstream main carries
#    the fix; fork-side sync stays owner-gated (upstream-merge-runbook.md).

# Phase 5 gate: pr-checks GREEN on the PR branch — zero errors in ported lines

# 2-pre. ATOMICITY + BASE check BEFORE the PR opens — standing rule
#     PR-BASE-PRE-OPEN in the Rules list below.

# 2c. CI gate (upstream triad) (v0.4.22 — encodes adolfousier/opencrabs
#     CONTRIBUTING.md: "You MUST pass all three before submitting a PR").
#     v0.4.28: the triad runs in CI via pr-checks.yml (cargo is FORBIDDEN on this box — box law);
#     a green run URL IS the citation.
#     FIRST push the head branch (step 3's command — the workflow checks the branch out from the fork).
#     MANDATORY FULL-GATE FORM (v0.4.149, owner order 2026-09-12):
#     Pre-PR testing MUST use the full gate (cargo test + fmt + clippy, NO --fast):
#       tools/oc-prchecks leshchenko1979/<feature>
#     or blocking wait form:
#       tools/oc-prchecks wait leshchenko1979/<feature>
#     (Do NOT pass --fast for final pre-PR verification. Full gate ensures 100% upstream test parity.)
#   Standing rules PR-GATE-STANDING in the Rules list below (flags verbatim
#   from pr-checks.yml; ANY red = fix cycle + re-dispatch, never a filed PR;
#   cite the green run URL in the PR body prep next to the smoke/run evidence).

# 3. push the head branch to the FORK (PR heads live there)
git -C ~/oc-wt-up-<feature> push -u origin leshchenko1979/<feature>

# 4. open the upstream PR — detailed description; body rules are canonical in
#    the Rules bullet below (fork-issue link at END, `Closes #N` FORBIDDEN).
#    PR TITLE TYPE PREFIX: every upstream
#    AND fork PR title starts with fix: / fix(scope): (bug fix), feat: /
#    feat(scope): (new capability), or chore: (tooling/CI/docs/deps — zero
#    user-visible change). The head-branch slug mirrors the type:
#    leshchenko1979/fix/<slug> | feat/<slug> | chore/<slug> (existing branches
#    untouched).
#    CROSS-REPO --HEAD LAW (Duty-4 P3, v0.4.80): --head is OWNER:BRANCH —
#    `leshchenko1979:<branch>`, literal branch name kept whole. The bare
#    `--head leshchenko1979/<branch>` form fails cross-repo with
#    "No commits between" (2026-09-01, adolfousier/opencrabs#1277 filing).
#    STAGED DRAFT PR MANDATE (owner order 2026-09-16):
#    When an upstream PR depends on another in-flight upstream PR or is part of a
#    multi-part staged wave, add `--draft` so upstream maintainers cannot merge out of order.
gh pr create -R adolfousier/opencrabs --base main --head leshchenko1979:leshchenko1979/<feature> \
  --title "<fix:|feat:|chore:> <concise feature title>" \
  --body "<detailed what/why, implementation notes, green run link, smoke-test evidence. Original issue: https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/N (exactly one)>" \
  [--draft]

# 5. close the tracked FORK issue with a pointer comment
gh issue close <issue-n> -R leshchenko1979/opencrabs -c "Implemented in upstream PR adolfousier/opencrabs#<pr-number>"

# 6. remove the worktree — done (dirty-tree gate + journal via oc-wt)
tools/oc-wt remove up-<feature>
```

Rules:
- **PR-FREEZE LAW (v0.4.93, owner "go all" on the Adolfo-protocol amendment
  2026-09-07):** an upstream PR is FROZEN the moment it is filed with CI green
  at push. NO re-port, NO force-push, NO head changes, NO body updates — even
  if upstream main moves or conflicts appear. *"Once you push it, you already
  did your job"* (Adolfo, 2026-09-07). Rationale: force-pushing a filed PR
  changes the head under the maintainer — if he already merged locally, the
  merge sha no longer matches and auto-close breaks (2026-09-07:
  #1426/#1427 rebased at 15:56, merged locally by maintainer at 17:22, heads
  mismatched, manual close required). Base-freshness (2-fresh) applies
  PRE-filing only. The ONLY valid re-engagement: maintainer explicitly asks
  for a change.
- **MAINTAINER-SIDE MERGES (v0.4.93):** conflict resolution, rebase, and
  fixes-on-top AFTER filing are the MAINTAINER's responsibility, done at
  merge time on his side. Contributor = push final work once.
  *"Whenever you're the maintainer approving changes: merge locally, fix
  conflicts on top, push, comment what you did."*
- **FINAL-PR STANDARD (v0.4.93):** file a PR only when it is genuinely final —
  tests green at push, no known gaps, no planned follow-ups. Force-pushes on
  filed PRs are the rare exception (~1-in-10), never procedure. All iteration
  happens fork-side BEFORE filing (fork = workspace, upstream PR = one-way
  handoff).
- Fork-only commits means EXACTLY that: no adolfousier sync merges, no other
  feature's commits, no bare CI-config churn unless it IS the feature.
- Cherry-pick conflicts → resolve, re-run the Phase 5 gate (pr-checks), continue. NEVER merge fork
  `main` into the PR branch — upstream gets clean commits only.
- **HARVEST VERIFICATION SWEEP (Duty-4, v0.4.71):** Full 4-leg sweep checklist (symbols, attributes, foreign hunks, patch-ids) lives in §Phase 7 Reference Rules below.
- **BASE-FRESHNESS AT FILING TIME (Triage lesson n=2083, v0.4.111):** the
  sweep and every gate run are valid against a NAMED upstream base — record
  the `adolfousier/main` sha the verification was tested against; a census/
  gate CLEAN result that does not name its base sha is not a CLEAN receipt
  (stale-base CLEANs masked #1451's CONFLICTING for hours).
- The PR body MUST reference THE issue as a FULL FORK URL at the END of the
  description (`Original issue: https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/N`
  — EXACTLY one, atomicity rule). `Closes #N` is FORBIDDEN on upstream PR bodies:
  it resolves against adolfousier's issue space, not ours (issues live on the
  fork). WE close the fork issue (step 5) right
  after the PR is up — do not wait for the maintainer merge.
- **QUALIFIED FORK REFS (fork [#54](https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/54)):**
  no bare `#N` with FORK issue numbers on any upstream surface (PR body,
  PR title, issue body, comment) OUTSIDE a code span — write
  `leshchenko1979/opencrabs#N` or the full URL (GitHub autolinks bare `#N`
  against adolfo's issue space). Code spans exempt. Bare `#N` stays reserved
  for UPSTREAM-local references. Incident + rationale:
  §Phase 7 Reference Rules below.
- One feature = one PR; never bundle two features to save a PR.
- **DEEP CORE ADVANCE HEADS-UP GATE (owner order 2026-09-17; paths corrected + executor assigned v0.4.204, HQ ruling 2026-09-18; config added to scope by owner order 2026-09-19):** If the PR touches **Deep Core** (runtime scheduler, compaction algorithms, provider routing/fallbacks, subagent orchestration, tool loop, configuration — loading, profile resolution, write guards, migrations — the PROSE scope is operative, paths are a reading aid: `src/cron/`, `src/brain/agent/service/tool_loop.rs`, `src/brain/agent/context.rs`, `src/brain/provider/`, `src/brain/tools/subagent/`, `src/config/`), post a concise 1-liner heads-up to either the **`OC Dev`** Telegram group chat (`-1003627148483`) or the **`Opencrabs Dev Factory`** group chat (tagging `@adolfodev`) before or simultaneously with opening the upstream PR: `Core heads-up: <symptom> → proposed fix in <subsystem> (PR #<N>)`. **HQ POSTS IT, not you** — §Telegram surface law bars an editor from invoking any telegram send tool, so send the 1-liner TEXT to HQ (`session_notify`, `delivery.mode="turn-end"`) in the turn you stage the PR; that discharges the gate and your harvest may proceed. Surface integrations (Telegram channel handler, cards, formatting) remain under autonomous maintainer authority and ship with 4-leg smoke receipts without advance group chat posting. Canon: `editor-upstream-pr.md §Deep Core Advance Heads-Up Gate`.
- **ATOMICITY & ZERO BUNDLING (owner order 2026-09-13; lane 1a63f103 proposal):** issues, PRs and commits are atomic —
  one problem per issue, one logical change per commit, one issue per PR. **1 Intent = 1 Unit.**
  Never mix features and bug fixes in the same issue, branch, or PR: a feature PR must carry exclusively
  feature commits, and a bugfix PR must carry exclusively fix commits. If a defect is found while working
  on a feature, file a separate fork issue and resolve it in an isolated branch/PR — never bundle the fix
  into the feature work. Every harvested commit carries an `Issue-Ref: #N` trailer matching EXACTLY the single
  issue the PR claims; no commit without one, no PR claiming more than one. A PR
  whose diff mixes fixed and unfixed concerns forces a binary status on a mixed bag
  and mislabels both. Gate with `./tools/oc-prchecks <branch>` and atomicity check BEFORE closing the issue.
- **PR LIFECYCLE:** One PR = one atomic change; a bug found in review is fixed
  FORWARD on the same PR or the PR is closed — no draft limbo. A MERGED PR is
  closed forever: follow-up work = new branch + new PR, NEVER extend a merged
  branch.
- **UPSTREAM CODING & TEST STANDARDS (CONTRIBUTING.md & Adolfo DM 2026-09-13):**
  - **Test isolation:** ALL tests MUST live under `src/tests/*_test.rs` registered in `src/tests/mod.rs`. Absolutely **NO inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`** blocks inside source files in `src/`. If an existing inline test block is found while editing a file, move it to `src/tests/` as part of the change.
  - **`mod.rs` declarations only:** Zero function definitions (`fn`) inside any `mod.rs`. Only doc comments, `mod`/`pub mod` statements, and `pub use` re-exports. Functions belong in cohesive child modules.
  - **No `Co-Authored-By`:** Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers to commit messages.
  - **Real tests over mocks:** Hit real structs and SQLite; tests must fail without the fix and pass with it.
  - **Zero error / warning suppression:** No `#[allow(dead_code)]` or `#[allow(unused)]` duct tape. Unused code must be deleted.
  - **`ONTOLOGY.md` synchronization:** If a change introduces, renames, or retires a concept, update `src/docs/reference/ONTOLOGY.md` in the same PR.

- **BUILD TRIGGERS = exactly TWO, no exceptions:** Canonical law lives in `SKILL.md §Hard rules` (`oc-deploy ship` or owner word; CI gate = `oc-prchecks`).
- **PR-BASE-PRE-OPEN (v0.4.71, Duty-4 P6):** an upstream PR head is a harvest
  branch off `adolfousier/main` — NEVER a fork-main-based branch; base +
  atomicity check runs BEFORE the PR opens (a post-open atomicity FALSE
  (fork-divergence commits) means the base was wrong before the PR existed).
- **PR-GATE-STANDING (step 2c):** triad flags VERBATIM from pr-checks.yml
  (fmt soft-fail mirrors upstream; clippy --locked --lib --bins --tests
  --all-features -D warnings; cargo test --locked --profile ci
  --all-features) — green here predicts green on adolfo's full gate. Iterate
  by EDITING CODE and re-dispatching pr-checks — NEVER run cargo locally
  (box law); test-placement policy → §Phase 4.
- Pre-flight gate (step 2c) is MANDATORY (v0.4.0): read the fmt STEP outcome,
  not just the run conclusion — soft-fail hides failures from the run.
- **Harvest census pre-flight gate (Cycle 5 / Duty 4, v0.4.143):** before opening an upstream PR or creating a harvest branch, run `tools/oc-harvest-census check <issue-number-or-slug>`. Refuse to file if rc=1 (finding: already MERGED or IN_FLIGHT upstream, or blocked).
- **Read the ADVISORY drop-list before branching (v0.4.218, finding `63d775f9`, cycle `20260919-c21`):**
  rc=0 `ELIGIBLE` means the target is **unharvested**, NOT that its feature can travel alone — Gate 4
  (`#365`) passes when **at least one** derived subject symbol resolves upstream, so an ELIGIBLE unit may
  still have its whole **substance** inside a fork-only symbol. Read every `ADVISORY: hunk inside
  fork-only symbol — dropped at packaging (<file> :: <sym>)` line (emitted on the rc=0 path; the ONLY
  substance-portability signal) and judge whether the dropped symbols are the unit's substance or merely
  incidental. **If the substance is dropped, the unit is a CHILD of the fork issue that introduced that
  symbol:** parent-link it (`gh issue edit <child> --parent <parent>`) and do **not** branch until the
  parent is merged upstream. The v0.4.71 symbol sweep at §Phase 7 Reference Rules is a **POST-branch**
  check and does **not** substitute for this one. (Incident: `#250` read as "branchable alone" off
  `ELIGIBLE … clean to branch and gate` with four ADVISORY lines in the same output.)
- `leshchenko1979/<slug>` is the RESERVED PR-head namespace (`leshchenko1979/…`
  branch names stand out in the upstream branch list): branches with that
  prefix are created ONLY in this phase, never developed on, never merged into
  fork `main` — and NOT deleted while their PR is still open (GitHub needs the
  head alive).

- **Checkable Completion Formula**: `DONE = Upstream PR created + fork issue closed with pointer comment + harvest worktree removed via oc-wt.`

## Phase 7b — PR lifecycle (monitor & unblock, v0.4.0)

Every OPEN upstream PR has an owning editor: the Session-Id trailers of its
harvested commits. When a PR is not mergeable, route by BLOCKER CLASS:

| Blocker | Who acts | Action |
|---|---|---|
| fmt/clippy/test failure in THIS feature's files | Owning editor (notified with log evidence via the mechanical post-swap fan-out — `oc-deploy fanout`) | **PR-freeze check first (v0.4.93):** fixes on a FILED PR only when CI failure exists at push time or maintainer asks. Otherwise frozen. If valid: fresh worktree off the PR head → fix → Phase 5 gate (pr-checks) + conflict-quality gate → signed push to the head |
| Merge conflicts with new upstream `main` | **Maintainer (v0.4.93)** | **DO NOT rebase/force-push the filed PR** — PR-freeze law. Conflict resolution on a filed PR is the maintainer's side (he merges locally, fixes on top, pushes, comments). Editor action: NONE beyond a factual comment ONLY if the maintainer asks; pre-filing, 2-fresh governs |
| Prerequisite unharvested (feature depends on fork-only changes from another issue) | **Editor / Triage (v0.4.174; Harvester RETIRED v0.4.176)** | **Explicit dependency notice permitted (v0.4.174 Dependent Upstream PRs Law)**: Allowed to file PR B while prerequisite PR A is pending, provided PR description states: `Depends on #<PR_A> (do not merge before #<PR_A>)`. Maintainer merges in chronological sequence. Alternatively, automated harvest pipeline holds PR B until PR A merges. |
| PRE-EXISTING upstream red (base fails in files we never touched) | ❌ NO editor pings — our code is innocent | housekeeping-PR candidate: issue filed + ledger-registered first (v0.3.8), Alexey decides |
| Maintainer rejects/closes the PR | Owning editor | REOPEN the linked issues with a pointer comment; record the outcome |

Hard rules: verify the failing log names files THIS PR actually touches BEFORE
pinging anyone (identical clippy walls on every PR can live on the upstream base). Soft-fail fmt diffs are
cosmetic — NEVER ping for fmt alone. Absorption ends the lifecycle: if the
maintainer merges/reimplements the feature, the PR story closes with a SHIPPED
UPSTREAM notice (Phase 6b item 6), not more fork-side work.
Two same-turn checks (v0.4.5): (1) BEFORE any push to a gated/frozen head branch,
RE-READ live gate state — latest issue comments + HQ notifies — session-start
knowledge structurally cannot know what changed mid-turn. (2) Before preparing ANY follow-up
commit targeting an open PR, check its state via API (`gh pr view <n> --json
state,mergedAt`) — it may have been maintainer-merged under you. **The state gate ALSO spans every port /
cherry-pick round toward a PR head (v0.4.14, proposal P4)**: before investing a
round, fresh `gh pr view <n> --json state` — if MERGED/CLOSED, STOP and report,
do not invest the round.

- **Checkable Completion Formula**: `DONE = PR state checked via API + blockers routed to responsible party (maintainer or owning editor) or closed with note.`

## Phase 7c — Mechanized Harvest Execution (v0.4.136, 2026-09-10; tightened v0.4.146)

Trigger: Operator harvest command (e.g. `/goal harvest ...`) dispatched to Editor lane via `session_notify` `[HARVEST DISPATCH: #N]` wire envelope from Triage.

Contract:
1. **Dedicated Worktree**: Create isolated worktree off `adolfousier/main` tip:
   `tools/oc-wt add up-<slug> leshchenko1979/fix/<slug> --create --from adolfousier/main`
2. **Cherry-pick & Pre-Sweep**: Cherry-pick source commits preserving trailers (`-x` / `Issue-Ref`), then verify clean lineage with `tools/oc-harvest-sweep leshchenko1979/fix/<slug> --base adolfousier/main`.
   - **Atomic Subsystem Bundling & Fix Squashing (Owner Order 2026-09-17, v0.4.200)**: A harvest unit is not a loose series of patch commits — it is a single, cohesive, self-contained atomic commit. Squash all follow-up bugfixes, clippy cleanups, test updates, and dependent child issue commits directly into the coherent parent feature commit before CI gating and filing upstream (`git reset --soft` / `git commit --amend` to consolidate into one clean commit). Maintainer Adolfo squashes multi-commit PRs into a single commit on upstream `main` anyway; shipping clean, all-in-one atomic commits eliminates upstream review noise and intermediate cherry-pick breakage.
   - **Dependency & Soak Inheritance (v0.4.187)**: Any `fix/*` modifying, depending on, or assuming an unharvested or soaking `feat/*` inherits the full 24h soak window of that base feature. It cannot be cherry-picked as a zero-hold fix if upstream lacks the underlying feature code.
   - **Native Sub-Issue / Child Pre-Flight Gate (Issue #188 / v0.4.198)**: A child issue, cleanup, or derivative task (such as deleting a script that exists only on fork or referencing unmerged docs/subsystems) must NEVER be harvested in isolation from its parent subsystem. If the parent subsystem is unharvested or unmerged upstream, refuse harvest staging until the parent lands upstream.
   - **In-Flight Lane Fence (v0.4.187)**: `tools/oc-harvest-dispatch vet <issue>` enforces this mechanically — it refuses a candidate whose subsystem is held by an active editor lane (rc 4 on `dispatch`). Read the fence from `tools/oc-ledger claim-ref <issue>` rather than hand-reading `workers-ledger.json` (a hand ledger read is the agent-memory-as-gate-input defect, lens J / F26). If an active lane is working the subsystem, hold harvest dispatch until that lane finishes, hot-swaps, and lands.
3. **Smoke & Gate Verification (Hard Gate, v0.4.146 / v0.4.149 / v0.4.152)**:
   - **4-Leg Smoke Pass**: Verify full 4-leg smoke pass (Lineage, Identity, CI Gate, Behavioral probe) is recorded with live receipts in `smoke-verdicts.log`. NEVER file an unsmoked PR.
   - **Cross-Boundary Unit Test Standards (v0.4.198)**: Verify that all PR unit tests test real cross-boundary interactions (e.g. real file writer -> reader in tempdir) rather than tautological helper comparisons against internal delegate functions.
   - **Packaging-sha stamps (v0.4.152)**: the row's `sha=` MUST be the packaging tip being filed (the branch head), never an ancestor. A row citing an ancestor does not cover the candidate — append a fresh row after the full gate; never edit the superseded one.
   - **Owner-dependent leg → PARK, don't chase (v0.4.152, owner order 2026-09-12)**: if the remaining behavioral evidence needs the OWNER (visual pass, tap, eye-confirm), it is NOT a blocking gate. Stamp the provable legs, append `PARKED-OWNER-EYE` (owner action + packaging sha), RELEASE the lane, and let the candidate roll to the next owner-present window. Never idle on an owner leg — the owner being away is exactly when this binds. Full law: `fleet-directives.md §Owner-Dependent Smoke Legs — Park, Don't Chase`.
   - **Mandatory Full PR Gate**: Push branch to origin (`leshchenko1979/opencrabs`) and trigger full PR checks (NO `--fast` mode):
     ```bash
     # Single-command blocking full PR gate:
     tools/oc-prchecks wait leshchenko1979/fix/<slug>
     # Or standard dispatch:
     tools/oc-prchecks leshchenko1979/fix/<slug>
     ```
     `--fast` is strictly prohibited for pre-PR testing; upstream PRs require 100% full test suite verification.
4. **Ship Execution**: When gate run exits GREEN (SUCCESS) AND 4-leg smoke pass is confirmed in `smoke-verdicts.log` (and ≥24h post-swap soak completed for `feat/*` or dependent fix bundles, counted strictly from the latest live deployment timestamp `deployed.ts` of ANY related node in the relationship graph — parent, sub-issues, and blockers, per 24h Feature Soak Harvest Law), Editor verifies upstream baseline state (`git diff origin/main...adolfousier/main`) and files the upstream PR (`gh pr create --repo adolfousier/opencrabs --base main --head leshchenko1979:leshchenko1979/fix/<slug> [--draft]`) citing the gate run ID, quoting the 4-leg smoke receipt, and linking the fork issue. If the underlying issue was already clean or resolved in upstream `main`, frame the PR narrative accurately as a clean helper extraction / refactoring / hardening rather than asserting an upstream regression (Upstream Baseline & Narrative Verification Law v0.4.198). (Note: Use `--draft` if the PR depends on another in-flight upstream PR per Staged Upstream Draft PR Mandate). **A PR number is not FILED until a same-turn `gh pr create` (or `gh pr view <N>`) output names it** — if a guard flags the claim (`phantom_blocked`) or the output was not witnessed, the PR is UNFILED: re-verify and re-dispatch (v0.4.152 §Guard-Flag Escalation Law; worked example: an announced PR #1514 that never existed cost ~3 h).
5. **Ack & Cleanup**: Remove harvest worktree, stamp completion in ledger, and notify Triage via `session_notify`.
   - **Checkable Completion Formula**: `DONE = 4-leg smoke pass in smoke-verdicts.log + full oc-prchecks green + upstream PR filed + harvest worktree cleaned up.`

## Phase 7 Reference Rules (Harvest Verification & Qualified Fork Refs)

Reference detail behind upstream PR harvesting and surfaces:

- **HARVEST VERIFICATION SWEEP (Duty-4, v0.4.71):** after
  conflict resolution on a harvested branch, BEFORE the first gate dispatch:
  (a) `git diff origin/main...HEAD` symbol sweep — grep the branch diff for
  fork-renamed/fork-only symbols and verify each has a live caller in the
  UPSTREAM tree (a write-side helper whose fork-paired read side lived in a
  renamed caller is a guaranteed clippy dead-code RED);
  (b) fork-side-only attribute sweep — diff fork-main vs PR-tree for
  `#[allow(clippy::…)]`/cfg gates on every function the PR touches, port them
  explicitly (trailer-matched cherry-picks miss attributes that rode a
  trailer-less fork commit);
  (c) foreign-hunk conflicts (a hunk on fork `main` but absent on the target
  base) resolve by DROPPING the foreign side, verified by diffstat delta vs the
  fork-side pick;
  (d) verify a rebase-ported commit by `git patch-id` before cherry-pick —
  post-port shas differ from lane records while content is identical.

- **UPSTREAM BASELINE & NARRATIVE VERIFICATION (Owner Order 2026-09-17, findings from PR #1615 review, v0.4.198):**
  When staging a fork bugfix or feature for upstream PR harvest, verify against live `adolfousier/main` whether upstream has already resolved the underlying issue or restructured the code path. If already addressed or clean upstream, frame the PR narrative accurately as a clean helper extraction, refactor, or hardening improvement rather than claiming an active upstream bug/regression.

- **CROSS-BOUNDARY UNIT TEST INTEGRITY (v0.4.198):**
  Unit tests in upstream PRs that assert file paths, contracts, or serialized formats must test real cross-boundary interaction (e.g. real file writer -> reader round-trip in a `tempfile` directory) rather than testing a helper function against its own internal delegate. Tautological unit tests provide zero regression protection across module boundaries and are rejected.

- **QUALIFIED FORK REFS on upstream surfaces (fork [#54](https://github.com/leshchenko1979/opencrabs/issues/54)):**
  a bare `#N` where N is a FORK issue number must never appear on an upstream
  surface (PR body, PR title, issue body, comment) OUTSIDE a code span — GitHub
  autolinks it against adolfousier's issue space and the tooltip points at an
  unrelated upstream issue (upstream #29 = memory-process question vs fork #29 =
  compaction signal). Write `leshchenko1979/opencrabs#N` or the full URL. Bare
  `#N` stays reserved for UPSTREAM-local references. Code spans are exempt
  (GitHub does not autolink inside backticks) — literal log-line quotes stay
  verbatim. Fork-side surfaces are unaffected (bare #N resolves correctly there).

## Deep Core Advance Heads-Up Gate (Core vs Integration Rule, Owner Order 2026-09-17)

Maintainer coordination protocol between Alexey (`@leshchenko1979`) and Adolfo (`@adolfodev`):
1. **Scope Classification**:
   - **Deep Core:** Runtime scheduler, context compaction algorithms, provider routing/fallbacks, subagent orchestration, tool execution loop, and **configuration** (loading, profile resolution, write guards, migrations). **The prose scope is OPERATIVE; the path list is a reading aid, never the definition.**
     - **Real paths (corrected v0.4.204, HQ ruling 2026-09-18; config added by owner order 2026-09-19):** runtime scheduler `src/cron/` (`scheduler.rs`, `pipeline.rs`, `trigger.rs`, `send_scope.rs`) · tool execution loop `src/brain/agent/service/tool_loop.rs` · context compaction `src/brain/agent/context.rs` · provider routing/fallbacks `src/brain/provider/` · subagent orchestration `src/brain/tools/subagent/` · **configuration `src/config/`** (`sections.rs`, `profile.rs`, `secrets.rs`, `guard.rs`, `live_home_guard.rs`, `repair.rs`, `registry_client.rs`).
     - **Defect this fixes:** the former list named `src/agent/` and `src/scheduler/`, NEITHER of which exists in the tree (`find src -type d -name 'scheduler*'` → empty). A filer reading the list as exhaustive would conclude a cron-runtime-scheduler change is NOT Deep Core — the wrong direction of error, and exactly the #317 shape.
   - **Surface Integrations:** Telegram channel handler, rich cards, MTProto/MCP bridge (`src/channels/telegram/`).
2. **The Advance Heads-Up Protocol (Venues: `OC Dev` Group Chat — `-1003627148483` / `3627148483`, or `Opencrabs Dev Factory` tagging `@adolfodev`):**
   - For any architectural change, behavior shift, or non-trivial fix touching **Deep Core**, post a concise technical 1-liner heads-up to either the **`OC Dev`** Telegram group chat or the **`Opencrabs Dev Factory`** group chat (tagging `@adolfodev`) *before* or *simultaneously with* opening the upstream PR:
     > `Core heads-up: <observed symptom/issue> → proposed fix in <subsystem> (PR #<N>)`
   - This ensures early alignment on core abstractions before or during maintainer review.
   - **WHO POSTS — HQ posts it, on the filing lane's behalf. There is NO editor carve-out (v0.4.204, HQ ruling 2026-09-18).** An editor lane CANNOT discharge this gate itself: SKILL.md §Telegram surface law forbids editors from invoking ANY telegram send/edit tool, not even into their own topic. Without this assignment the two laws bind the same actor and the obligation has **no executor on the filing side**. So: the filing editor sends HQ the 1-liner text (`session_notify`, `delivery.mode="turn-end"`) in the same turn it stages the PR; HQ posts it to the venue. This is NOT a new carve-out — it is the existing lifecycle assignment, since SKILL.md §Upstream relations item 5 makes **Maintainer Interaction (incl. the OC Dev chat heads-up) HQ's area**. The obligation is on the CHAIN, not the filer: a lane that has put the text in HQ's queue has discharged it, and its harvest may proceed.
3. **Surface Integrations Autonomy:**
   - Changes to Telegram, rich card rendering, formatting, and local developer tooling remain under our autonomous maintainer authority; they ship directly to upstream PRs with verified 4-leg smoke receipts without requiring advance group chat discussion.

## Dependent Upstream PRs Law (Maintainer Consensus, 2026-09-14; Draft Mandate 2026-09-16)

When PR B depends on PR A (which is not yet merged upstream):
1. **Explicit Dependency Notice Permitted:** It is explicitly allowed to file PR B while PR A is open/pending, provided the PR description clearly states:
   `Depends on #<PR_A> (do not merge before #<PR_A>)`
2. **Staged Upstream Draft PR Mandate (owner order 2026-09-16):** When an upstream PR depends on another in-flight upstream PR or is part of a multi-part staged wave, it MUST be filed with `gh pr create --draft` so upstream maintainers cannot merge out of order before prerequisites land. Once PR A merges upstream, the draft status on PR B is converted to ready for review.
3. **Maintainer Order of Processing:** Upstream maintainer tackles dependent PRs in commit/chronological sequence (PR A merged before PR B).
4. **Deferred Automated Publishing:** Alternatively, automated harvest pipelines may hold PR B until PR A merges via harvest watch / cron triggers.

## Upstream issue filings — report-only (owner 2026-08-28 15:17Z)

**Offload order — CORRECTED (owner 2026-09-01, "Wait, i was talking about prs only. Revert issues"):** "Offload to upstream" applies to **PRs only** (when we fix OpenCrabs-source bugs, the fix ships as an upstream PR per the existing PRs-only rule). **Issue reports NEVER go upstream** — the fork is the issues home, permanently. The 2026-09-01 issue-migration (adolfousier #1279–#1286 for fork 70/33/38/58/35/60/65 + TEXT_ACCUM) was misread, withdrawn same day: all 8 upstream issues closed as withdrawn, all 7 fork issues reopened, #1255 cross-link deleted. #66 remains not-upstream-eligible (upstream #1260 closed pointing back to the fork; needs owner-level follow-up with adolfo).

When the owner tells us to FILE an issue upstream (adolfousier/opencrabs), the editor does NOT fix it: the filed report is the deliverable, and fixing the upstream-reported defect is adolfo's lane. No editor lane writes fix code or opens a fix PR for an upstream-filed issue unless the owner explicitly orders the fix — follow-up REPORTING on the filed thread stays allowed (per the #1255 exception).

## Cross-fork PR inspection — fetch head from the fork remote (Duty-4 proposal, owner-approved 2026-09-06)

Inspecting a cross-fork PR (`gh pr view N -R upstream`): fetch the head branch
from the FORK remote (`git fetch origin <head>`), never from upstream — a
fork-namespaced head does not exist there (2026-09-05 #1392 404 incident).
Same root fact as ledger n=1537's `gh pr create` namespaced-head lesson.
